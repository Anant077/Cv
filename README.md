Implemented 3 algorithms names are - Harris Corner Detection , Shi-Tomasi corners and Blob Detectors.
Theory - Harris Corner Detector identifies corners by detecting areas with significant intensity changes in both directions using image gradients.
         It's fast and detects many corners,but may pick up unstable or noisy points. Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector improves on Harris by using the 
         minimum eigenvalue method, making it more stable and reliable for tracking,though it detects fewer points and is slightly slower.
         In contrast, the Blob Detector (SimpleBlobDetector) focuses on finding distinct blob-like regions based on shape and
         brightness properties like area and circularityâ€”ideal for detecting round objects like coins or cells, but not suited for sharp edges or corners.
